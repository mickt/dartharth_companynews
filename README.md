# dartharth_companynews
A simple and small module for Drupal 9.

It is used to withdraw in the site of the list of the last added news of the company such as company_news contents with the 979 id Taxonomy term. 

The list displays the name of the news, the date of creation, the link to the news and the photo news, which is taken from the first image in the body of the node with the style of the image of news_aside_grid.
